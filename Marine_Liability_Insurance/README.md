# Marine Liability Pricing Project

## 📌 Project Context

This project is my attempt to explore how **data-driven pricing strategies** can be applied in the marine insurance sector.  
The idea came from the growing challenges in insurance pricing due to **increasing claims** and **changing risk patterns**.

For this project, I worked with a case study inspired by **Oceanic Shipping Co.**, a fictional shipping company that has suffered substantial losses from recent claims. The goal is to design a **pricing model** that is both accurate and sustainable, while also providing insights into the underlying risks.
